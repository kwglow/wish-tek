- so much remains distant, out of reach.
- L.A. remains elusive to me even now.
- Los Angeles confounds us, the multitudes it contains.
- The light of the place throws you into such a trance.
- It's the light that breaks hearts in LA.
- This was a lovely makeshift city.
- Even the trees and plants did not belong here.
- Tip the world over and everything loose will land in Los Angeles. 
- It was the city that held us, the city they said had no center...
- it's kind of hard to keep track of time here.
- Los Angeles feels like only a half-formed dream-
- The prevailing winds here are from the west.
- It is a city that moves entirely upward
